# Diamond Star Combat
 
A Minecraft Aircraft Combat mod inspired by Mcheli. Planes, Radars, Missiles, Explosions! Customize your vehicle's weapon loadout. You can use a radar to shoot a missile at a target beyond your render distance. Shoot heat seeking missiles at nearby planes and use flares to defend yourself in dynamic dog fights. Use the somewhat realistic flight physics to pull of baller manuvers. Or shoot lazer guided bombs at enemies on the ground. 

## Still Beta Contribute Please

This mod is far from finished. Most of the core for the mod is complete, however there is still a lot of work to do. Here is a list of things where I would appreciate your controbutuion. Please let me know in this discord server if you plan on contributing. 

- I want to add more planes, helicoptors, cars, tanks, boats, and any other vehicle type you think would be cool. If someone better at modeling than me could make an f22 or a mig 29 for example I'd appreciate it. 

- My item textures sorta suck. So similar to the previous point, if someone better than me at making textures wants to redo some of them please.

- The plane physics are definetly not final. Open to feedback.

- Open to feedback on anything actually. Did you find a bug. Could certain functions be more efficient? Is my code bad?
