# Diamond Star Combat
 
A Minecraft Aircraft Combat mod inspired by Mcheli. Planes, Radars, Missiles, Explosions! Customize your vehicle's weapon loadout. You can use a radar to shoot a missile at a target beyond your render distance. Shoot heat seeking missiles at nearby planes and use flares to defend yourself in dynamic dog fights. Use uhh...real life inspired flight physics to pull of baller maneuvers. Or shoot laser guided bombs at enemies on the ground.

## Controls

Here are the flight control keys by default.

- Yaw Left/Right = A/D
- Pitch Up/Down = W/S
- Roll Left/Right = Left/Right Arrow Keys
- Throttle Up/Down = Up/Down Arrow Keys

When you first get in a plane you are in free look mode. Which means when you move the mouse, the camera changes direction. You may notice that it's annoying to switch hands between the mouse and the arrow keys. That is why I added this next key. 

- Flip Controls = Left Alt

If the controls are kept at default then pressing Left Alt swaps WASD with the arrow keys. So while holding Left Alt, W is Throttle Up, A is Roll left, and the Down Arrow is Pitch Down for example. This allows the pilot to quickly roll or change throttle without moving your hands. 

There is one more condition where controls gets swapped and that is switching to mouse mode.

- Mouse Mode = Left Control

Now the movements of your mouse are mapped to Pitch and Yaw and WASD control Throttle and Roll. 

Other Controls

- Switch Seat = ;
- Switch Weapon = G
- Flare = V
- Landing Gear = L
- Open Plane Inventory = U
- Center Mouse = Right Alt
- Special (Breaks/Hover) = Space

## Parts System

If the aircraft is on the ground you can press the Plane Menu Button which is U by default. This allows you to add/remove/customize the plane's internal parts. You theoretically give any aircraft any weapon load out. You can also customize the radars, fuel tanks, and engines. However every part has weight and if you make your aircraft too heavy it may not get of the ground or be prone to drop out of the sky during turns. 

## Still Beta Contribute Please

This mod is far from finished. Most of the core for the mod is complete. However, there is still a lot of work to do, and I can't do everything. I believe this project could be so much more if others help develope it. So here is an incomplete list of stuff I want to add and would appreciate assistance. Please let me know in the discord server if you plan on contributing. I or someone else may already be working on your idea and we'd be happy to have an extra keyboard! Also note this list is not static or final, and if you think of something that's not here let me know!

- I will be adding comments around the mod in an attempt to explain how it works. 
- I want to add more planes, helicopters, cars, tanks, boats, anti air defenses and any other vehicle type you think would be cool. Someone better at modeling than me could make an f22, mig 29, the Ornithopter from Dune, or an X-Wing from Star Wars for example. Make what you think would be cool!
- My item textures sorta suck. So similar to the previous point, if someone better than me at making textures wants to redo some of them please.
- The plane physics are definitely not final. Open to feedback.
- Open to feedback on anything actually. Did you find a bug. Could certain functions be more efficient? Is my code bad?
- Pvp balance is something I really want to get right. Let me know if something should be nerfed or buffed. 
- If you don't want to add your content to the base mod I want it to be easy for developers to make addons for this mod. But I haven't put much thought into it yet because I'm trying to build up the base content for this mod. Let me know if something is making addon development difficult.
