# Diamond Star Combat
 
A Minecraft Aircraft Combat mod inspired by Mcheli. Planes, Radars, Missiles, Explosions! Customize your vehicle's weapon loadout. You can use a radar to shoot a missile at a target beyond your render distance. 
Shoot heat seeking missiles at nearby planes and use flares to defend yourself in dynamic dog fights. Use semi-realistic flight physics to perform epic maneuvers, or shoot laser guided bombs at enemies on the ground. 

Please go to the __**[WIKI](https://github.com/1whohears/DiamondStarCombat/wiki)**__ for ***Controls*** and other information!
